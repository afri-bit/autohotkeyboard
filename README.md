## Prerequisites

* Windows System (Recommended Windows 10)
* [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

## Usage

* Clone the repository as following

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/afri-bit/autohotkeyboard.git
  ```

* Go to scripts directory
  ```
  cd autohotkeyboard/ahk
  ```
  This folder contains different scripts that you can use to extend the shortcut keys on your keyboard. 
  
* Option 1: Double click the script to activate the script

* Option 2: Autostart  
  You can make the script running automatically after login to Windows by following the instruction below:
  * Press `Win` + R
  * Execute command `shell:startup`  
    A folder will open after you executing the command above. Windows will execute all the applications / shortcuts in this folder after you login for the first time.
  * Create a shortcut of your script to this folder or copy the script directly here.  
    I recommend you to create a shortcut, since it offers you more flexibility in case you want to change the script.
